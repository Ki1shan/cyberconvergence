CYBER THREAT INTELLIGENCE DASHBOARD REPORT:
-------------------------------------------

-----------------
PROJECT OVERVIEW:
-----------------
This project is a Cyber Threat Intelligence Dashboard that provides security professionals with a centralized platform to investigate Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) by querying multiple threat intelligence APIs. The system currently integrates with:

-> VirusTotal API: For malware analysis and reputation data
-> AbuseIPDB API: For IP reputation and abuse scoring

The application features a Flask-based web interface with MongoDB storage for historical IOC lookups, presented in a clean, dark-themed dashboard.

-----------------------
TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE:
-----------------------
-> Frontend: HTML5 with Bootstrap 5 dark theme
-> Backend: Python Flask
-> Database: MongoDB (via Flask-PyMongo)
-> APIs Integrated: VirusTotal v3, AbuseIPDB v2
-> Containerization: Docker with docker-compose

-------------
KEY FEATURES:
-------------
1. IOC Lookup System:
   -> Single search interface for IPs/domains
   -> Parallel API queries to multiple threat intelligence sources
   -> Results normalization for consistent display

2. Data Persistence:
   -> MongoDB storage of all lookups with timestamps
   -> Historical view of previous investigations

3. Dashboard Interface:
   -> Responsive table display of IOC results
   -> Visual representation of threat scores
   -> Clean, security-focused dark theme

-------------------
SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------------
PREREQUISITES:
   -> Docker and docker-compose installed
   -> API keys for:
       * VirusTotal (VT_API_KEY)
       * AbuseIPDB (ABUSEIPDB_API_KEY)
       
DEPLOYMENT STEPS: 
   1. Start the application:
       # docker-compose up -d
   2. Access the dashboard at: http://localhost:5000  
   
------------
USAGE GUIDE:
------------
1. Basic Operation:
   -> Enter an IP address or domain in the search field
   -> Click "Lookup" to query both APIs simultaneously
   -> View results in the dashboard table

2. Result Interpretation:
   -> VirusTotal: Shows last analysis statistics
   -> AbuseIPDB: Displays abuse confidence score (0-100)

3. Historical Data:
   -> All lookups are stored and displayed in reverse chronological order
   -> Timestamps help track when each IOC was investigated
   
------------------------
SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:
------------------------
1. Environment Variables:
   -> All sensitive credentials are loaded from environment variables
   -> Never hardcoded in the application

2. Database Security:
   -> MongoDB runs in a separate container
   -> Network isolation between web and database components

3. API Security:
   -> All external API calls use HTTPS
   -> API keys are transmitted in headers
   
--------------------
FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:
--------------------
1. Additional API Integrations:
   -> AlienVault OTX
   -> Shodan
   -> ThreatMiner

2. Enhanced Features:
   -> IOC type auto-detection (IP, domain, hash)
   -> Bulk lookup capability
   -> Scheduled rescans of historical IOCs
   -> User authentication system

3. Improved UI:
   -> Visual threat score indicators
   -> Geolocation mapping
   -> Exportable reports (PDF/CSV)
   
-----------
CONCLUSION:
-----------
This Cyber Threat Intelligence Dashboard provides security teams with a powerful, containerized tool for rapid IOC investigation. The integration with leading threat intelligence APIs combined with historical data storage creates a valuable resource for threat analysts. The modular design allows for easy expansion to include additional data sources and features.
