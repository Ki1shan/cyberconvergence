# cyberconvergence
 offensive + defensive tools converge

This repository contains two cybersecurity-focused projects developed using Python, HTML. Both projects are self-contained, well-documented, and built for hands-on penetration testing and threat analysis.

##  Projects Included
   1. Web Application Vulnerability Scanner
A Flask-based automated scanner that detects common web vulnerabilities like XSS, SQLi, and CSRF. Built using Python, Selenium, and BeautifulSoup.

   2. Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) Dashboard
A Flask + MongoDB dashboard that investigates IPs/domains using VirusTotal and AbuseIPDB APIs. Built for threat analysts to quickly query, track, and visualize IOC data.
